## Inspiration
The inspiration behind NoteifyMe came from the founder's personal experience of missing out on important updates and contributions from classmates during college. As computer science students, we realized that there was a need for a tool that could automate reminders for important updates, notes, and contributions from classmates, and professors. NoteifyMe was born to fulfill this need and provide a seamless way for students to stay on top of their coursework and collaborate effectively.
## What it does
NoteifyMe is a Discord bot that allows students to receive automated reminders about important updates, notes, and contributions from their classmates and professors. The bot integrates with the student's Discord server, and the student can set up notifications for specific channels or courses. The bot sends reminders about upcoming deadlines, class notes, and contributions from classmates, ensuring that students never miss out on important information. NoteifyMe is also customizable, allowing students to set up reminders based on their preferences and schedule.
## How we built it
NoteifyMe was built using Discord's API, the MongoDB data platform and HTML/CSS/Node.js to create the bot's functionality. We also implemented a database to store user data and preferences, ensuring that the bot could provide accurate and personalized notifications for each user. Github, OpenAI, and the Discord platform improved our project’s organization to meet LA Hacks’s 36-hour deadline.
## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we faced was integrating NotifyMe with various Discord servers, each with their own unique settings and configurations. We had to ensure that the bot functioned seamlessly across different servers and channels without any issues, while ensuring that the bot could handle large volumes of notifications, without overwhelming the user with too many reminders.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of creating a tool that simplifies the lives of students and helps them stay on top of their coursework. NoteifyMe has received positive feedback from student organizers for LA Hacks; they see our tool helping them collaborate more effectively with their classmates.  Meanwhile, we're tinkering with the bot's customization capabilities, which allow users to personalize their notifications based on their preferences and schedule.
## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we received feedback from student organizers, other hackers, company representatives and even outside visitors, and made updates to the bot's functionality based on their generous advice. We also learned the importance of scalability, ensuring that the bot could handle large volumes of notifications without any issues, which is a priority for a college campus of tens of thousands of students.
## What's next for NoteifyMe
We're working on expanding NoteifyMe's functionality to include more features, such as integration with other platforms and additional customization options. We're also continuing to gather feedback from students to improve the bot's functionality and ensure that it remains a valuable tool for students.
